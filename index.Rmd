Welcome! I am a quantitative researcher and Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Houston. My research focuses on public opinion and political psychology, most notably why and how American citizens form anti-democratic beliefs. Prior to attending the University of Houston, I received my MA in Political Science from SUNY Stony Brook, and two BAs in Political Science and Philosophy from William Paterson University of New Jersey.

In my dissertation, I argue that feeling a lack of control over oneâ€™s life makes people more likely to endorse conspiracy theories, adopt populist beliefs, and support political violence. I am also interested in identifying the causes and consequences of misinformation and propaganda. Alongside my substantive research, I am also interested in survey and experimental design, such as how to improve measures capturing important political concepts and how to design more effective experiments. My prior research has appeared in *Public Opinion Quarterly* and *Political Research Quarterly*.

Although my work primarily utilizes quantitative methodology to probe political questions, I was originally trained in 19th and 20th century German philosophy and am still very much involved in the problems and solutions critical theory offers in today's society. Outside of academia, I enjoy consuming the stories offered by science fiction through various mediums, playing bass guitar, and traveling.
